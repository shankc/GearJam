An Android app, to fetch and stream music according your favorite instruments, and maybe help you find your genre and instrument affinity along
the way ;)

Android Version:
Min Ver: API 19 (Minimum android api version required kitkat).

Technicalities:
The app classifies music according to various instruments , and further classifiy the music according to genre preferences,
the app streams songs from the SoundCloud database. and features song download for offline playing :D. (if the song creator allows for it :P).

Note:
None of the musical content is mine, all credit goes to soundcloud, and the various fabulous artits.
on a side note, aren't you tired of the sameold chartbusters, do try and listen to other artists out there, who are equally good.

Not yet on playstore, still deciding on the logo :(
feel free to contribute though.
